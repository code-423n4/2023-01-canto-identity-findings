# Finding 1 : Wrong natspecs

```
    /// @notice Fee (in BPS) that is charged for every mint (as a percentage of the mint fee). Fixed at 10%.
    uint256 public constant CID_FEE_BPS = 1_000;
```
Its says here, fee would charge for every new nft mint, but in actual its getting charge for adding a new entry for the subprotocol. Although implementation seems correct but natspecs are misleading.
