# Finding 1: Reduntant code should be removed
It can cause confusion and increase the complexity of the code. They also increase the size of the compiled code, leading to higher gas costs. 

It's good practice to remove reduntant code from the contract. Consider revision the other contract for unused code as well, here is the one instance;

# Finding 2: Use unchecked to save gas in add() 

For solidity versions >=0.8, the default behaviour is to check for overflow/underflow and if occur throw an error. It consumes some extra gas in computation. And as `cidFee` is derived from `subprotocolFee`, `subprotocolFee` will always be greater than `cidFee`, there is no way it can underflow.  

Wrapping if block under unchecked will save the gas. 

*Recommendation*

*Before*

```
File : CidNFT.sol
        ...
        uint96 subprotocolFee = subprotocolData.fee;
        if (subprotocolFee != 0) {
            uint256 cidFee = (subprotocolFee * CID_FEE_BPS) / 10_000;
            SafeTransferLib.safeTransferFrom(note, msg.sender, cidFeeWallet, cidFee);
            SafeTransferLib.safeTransferFrom(note, msg.sender, subprotocolOwner, subprotocolFee - cidFee);
        }
        ...
```

*After*

```
File : CidNFT.sol
        ...
        uint96 subprotocolFee = subprotocolData.fee;
        unchecked { 
             if (subprotocolFee != 0) {
             uint256 cidFee = (subprotocolFee * CID_FEE_BPS) / 10_000;
             SafeTransferLib.safeTransferFrom(note, msg.sender, cidFeeWallet, cidFee);
             SafeTransferLib.safeTransferFrom(note, msg.sender, subprotocolOwner, subprotocolFee - cidFee);
             }
        }
        ...
```
